(you make a text file where each line has a process or service you wish to track any outages of)
there will be two different executables (or you could make them services with some extra codation)

---------First executable will be for Windows Processes
it will first determine how many other ProcDeadSwitch Executables are running
then how many procDeadSwitch services are running
add those numbers and add one to that number and that is the line of the text file it will read to determine which process it is keeping track of

it will display which process it will be looking for on the first line
it will prompt for the heartbeat check timer, an integer in minutes

thread sleep for approximately whatever minutes * 50000??? depends on the processor i guess

if the process is not found?? then send an email to so and so. 

we would need a service to monitor this dead switch, or redundant dead switches maybe? who's watching the watchmen... we are.
